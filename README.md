## Design Achievements (10 points)

How does your site uses CRAP principles?
All of these examples CRAP principles.

Constrast: The idea behind constrast is to avoid elements on the page that are similar. For example: The login page has a minimalistic white background, while the Tasks Page has a colorful background for clear visual distinction.


Repetition: Repeat the visual elements of the design throughout the piece. Consistent background colors (pink & grey) across task-related elements. "Create Task" and "Edit Task" buttons maintain uniform styling and font choices.


Alignment: Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Elements are strategically positioned, e.g., the Registration and Login boxes are centered for a balanced layout.


Proximity: Items relating to each other should be grouped close togetherTasks, priorities, dates, and action buttons are placed within the same section for better readability.
